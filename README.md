#### 1. Subtask recommendation
     a. Assigning subtask for human-player.
     b. Subtask could be the chain in HDQfD or Markov-controller or hand-crafted chain.
     c. Potential research: Comparing Human-player performance between different provided chains.
#### 2. Action recommendation
     a. Assigning action in the subtask for human-player.
     b. For action, things might be a bit complex.
     c. 10 basic actions: 
        Move -- [forward, back, left, right]  
        Camera -- [up, down, left, right] 
        Combo -- [forward+jump] 
        Attack 
     d. Special actions:
        Craft -- [Planke, stick, crafting_table, wooden_pickaxe, etc]: converting raw material
        Place -- [item]: placing item(s)
        NearbyCraft -- [item]: Craft item(s) when something nearby
        Equip -- [item]


# **MineRL intelligent agent:**
**The MineRL intelligent agent is based on HDQfD (forgER) algorithm, see [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09939) [[Github]](https://github.com/cog-isa/forger).**<br/>
**Notes:** <br/>
- We cannot reproduce the results in the paper, could be caused by multiple reasons, e.g: 1.dataset; 2.Bugs;<br/>
- We changed some parts of the algorithm to improve the performance.<br/>
- You will find more detals in the forger folder. 

# **MineRL Markov Model:**
**In order to find out how subtask state transitions are transfered, we implemented a Markov Model to analyze them. We first split the whole IronPickaxe dataset to different subtasks, e.g: Start, Log, Planks, Crafting tables etc, to extract the subtasks. After that, to keep consistency, we filtered some poor quality trajectories. Finally, the most greedy subtask path was generated by our Markov model.**.
